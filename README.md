# Pneumonia Detection System Using CNN

This repository contains the code for a Pneumonia Detection System that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The live application is accessible on AWS EC2 at [18.219.115.22:8080](http://18.219.115.22:8080).

## Overview
Pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening respiratory infection, and early detection is crucial for treatment. This system aids in diagnosing pneumonia by analyzing chest X-ray images, providing quick and automated results. Built using CNNs, it achieves high accuracy by identifying visual indicators of pneumonia.

## Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used to train and deploy the CNN model
- **Gradio**: Provides the frontend interface for easy image upload and results display
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the live application for scalable access
- **Docker**: Enables containerization for consistent and reliable deployment
